    "In this notebook, we have implemented the LPFormer model as described in the paper \"LPFormer: An Adaptive Graph Transformer for Link Prediction\" and applied it to the Marvel Universe dataset. The implementation includes all key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GCN-based node representation learning**\n",
    "2. **PPR-based relative positional encodings with order invariance**\n",
    "3. **GATv2 attention mechanism for adaptive pairwise encoding**\n",
    "4. **Efficient node selection via PPR thresholding using Andersen's algorithm**\n",
    "5. **Proper evaluation metrics (MRR, AUC, AP)**\n",
    "6. **LP factor analysis for performance evaluation**\n",
    "7. **Example link predictions with visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is optimized for GPU execution and follows the paper's specifications closely. The model demonstrates strong performance on the Marvel Universe dataset, effectively predicting links between heroes and comics based on the graph structure and node features."
